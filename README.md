# Introduction

Energy Star X is a GUI version of the open source software [Energy Star](https://github.com/imbushuo/EnergyStar/), developed with Windows App SDK (WinUI 3).

It leverages Windows 11's [EcoQoS API](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/performance-diagnostics/introducing-ecoqos/) to throttle background applications to improve system thermal and battery life.


# Requirements

## Hardware

- Intel 10th gen or newer mobile processors
- AMD Ryzen 5000 or newer mobile processors
- Qualcomm mobile processors

## Software

- Works best on Windows 11 22H2 (Build 22621) and above.
- Works on Windows 11 21H2 (Build 22000), but not as well.


# Usage

Let it run in the background in the system tray. You can choose to run it automatically on startup in the settings page.

You can see a green leaf icon in the "Status" column of the Task Manager next to background processes that are throttled.

# Known Limitations

- If you use some taskbar enhancement software such as [StartAllBack](https://www.startallback.com/), this app may crash when you hover over system tray icon.
- Child processes do not get boosted when the parent process receives input focus.
- System processes (which is Session 0) do not get throttled. Currently there are some assumption that non-user processes know what they are doing.
